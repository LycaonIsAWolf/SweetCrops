This is a game I made with my friend [Efi](https://twitter.com/efimero) for [Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). You can download the finished product [here](https://lycaon.itch.io/sweet-crops).

This repository contains all the code I made for this project. It does *not* include the prefabs or models/textures, so you won't be able to download this and open it in Unity and have it work. The game is free, though, so there's that.
